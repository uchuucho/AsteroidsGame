# Asteroid Game

This is a simple remake of the classic Asteroids game built with **Python** and **Pygame**.

You control a small triangular spaceship floating in space, navigating around and shooting asteroids that drift across the screen.

The goal is to survive as long as possible by avoiding or destroying incoming asteroids before they collide with you.

Asteroids come in 3 different sizes, and when you shoot a large one, it breaks apart into smaller pieces that are harder to avoid.

Shots have a cooldown so you canâ€™t spam, adding a bit of strategy to when you decide to fire.

The game uses **object-oriented programming** to organize the player, asteroids, shots, and the field itself, making it easy to understand and expand.

It features **smooth movement**, **rotation**, **collision detection**, and simple but engaging gameplay reminiscent of the original arcade classic.
